               <h2>A Path to Citizenship</h2>
               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
                  Going by Sasquatch, Yeti, Momo, and most commonly, Hubert “Bigfoot”, the eight-foot-tall mammalian has again appeared across U.S. headlines.  Following genetic
                   analysis of a hair believed to belong to the big F, sasquatch advocates known as Quatchies are calling for rights and even citizenship to be given to Bigfeet 
                   across the country.  The study conducted and Washington University’s cryptid department showed that Bigfeet are genetically identical to modern humans.  
                   Quatchies have mobilized in Washington D.C. demanding that U.S. Congress grant citizenship to Bigfeet immediately.  A large sasquatch statue wielding an American 
                   flag has been erected before the White House.  President Kanye West, a vocal sasquatch advocate, has been meeting with his cabinet to discuss the developing 
                   situation.

               <h2>Kanye’s Relentless Advocacy</h2>
               <p>
                  Later this week, President West, who now goes by President Ye, is meeting with Speaker of the House Marilyn Manson to address the increasingly violent protest in D.C.  
                  Other members of the Christian Billionaire Genius party are expected work with house Democrats to pass bipartisan legislation by the end of next week.  President Ye 
                  has consistently insisted that Bigfeet are the indigenous people of the Americas and that the Western United States be ceded and governed by Bigfeet going forward. 
                  To show his support of the movement, President Ye is releasing his new size 56 Yeezys.

               <h2>Bigfeet Alien Origins</h2>
               <p>
                  House Republicans are expected to fight any measures to grant bigfeet any rights in the United States.  Senator Adam Sandler (R-West Dakota) argues that bigfeet 
                  cannot be granted citizenship because of his alien origins.  Sandler goes even further claiming that bigfeet need to be deported from the United States and back 
                  into deep space.  Sandler told Congress, “He has yet to see a single example of a Bigfoot birth certificate.”  Top economist have also expressed concerns with 
                  granting bigfeet citizenship. According to InfoWars, bigfeet citizenship would crash the domestic shoe market leaving honest normal footed Americans shoeless for 
                  years to come.

               <h2>Elon Musk to the Rescue</h2>
               <p>
                  The infamous billionaire and dictator of Canada, Elon Musk has vowed to be both the first person to discover bigfoot and subsequently deport him in his Star Fox 3
                   rocket.  Musk’s rocket is being specially designed to accommodate Bigfoot’s large feet.  The Star Fox 3 will be  powered by naturally aspirated electric V2 motor
                    and include larger clutch and gas pedals.    Musk joked, “The easy part was designing the rocket.  The hard part will be teaching a large ape how to drive manual.
                    ” Musk has received criticism for rushing production of his rocket and nany have safety concerns with an ape operating a large rocket.
